# This file ensures the keys/ directory is tracked by git

# The actual .pem files are ignored by .gitignore (sensitive keys)

#

# To generate JWT RSA keys locally:

#

# 1. Generate private key:

# openssl genrsa -out private_key.pem 2048

#

# 2. Generate public key from private key:

# openssl rsa -in private_key.pem -pubout -out public_key.pem

#

# These commands should be run locally and keys kept private (never commit to git)
